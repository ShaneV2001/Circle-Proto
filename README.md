# Circle-Proto

Welcome to the README file for Circle-Proto. This README provides an overview of the HTML and JavaScript files and their functionality.

## Overview

Circle-Proto consists of two iterations of a simple HTML and JavaScript animation project involving circles. "Circle" represents the first iteration, where a circle slowly moves to the edge of the screen. "Circle2" is the second iteration, featuring a bouncing circle animation between the vertical bounds of the page.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. `Circle.html`: This HTML file contains the structure of the webpage for the first iteration.
2. `Circle.js`: This JavaScript file contains the animation logic for the first iteration. Uses a "addEventListener" command.
3. `Circle2.html`: This HTML file contains the structure of the webpage for the second iteration.
4. `Circle2.js`: This JavaScript file contains the animation logic for the second iteration. Uses a "querySelector" command. 

## HTML Structure

Both `Circle.html` and `Circle2.html` files contain the basic structure of the webpages, which include the canvas element for rendering the circle animation.

## JavaScript Functionality

The `Circle.js` file slowly moves a circle across the screen, while the `Circle2.js` file creates a bouncing animation effect for the circle within the vertical bounds of the page.

## How to Use

To view the animations, open the respective HTML files (`Circle.html` or `Circle2.html`) in a web browser.
